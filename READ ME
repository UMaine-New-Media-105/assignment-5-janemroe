Chalenge 1 - I drew a bubble and by using classes and constructor arguments I was able to make 5 of the same bubbles and have them shake.

Challenge 2 - Using an array with loops I was able to take the code for the 5 bubbles I wrote for the last challenge and make 50 bubbles.

Challenge 3 - I created the beginning of a pool table simulation. Pool balls move aback and forth across the screen which will eventually be my breeders, and a cue ball that will eventually be my catcher. There are also spotlights that move randomly around the screen.

Challenge 4 - This is crashing my browser! I made it so that the pool balls in the simulation duplicate when they collide. Because of how I originally drew my pool balls I had to rewrite the function to add a ball in order for the duplication to work right. Theres a spawn delay and everything so not really sure why its crashing but maybe I just need to start with less on the screen.

Challenge 5 - In challenge 4 I had a couple issues with my code, but the major issue was that I wasn't comparing the spawnDelay and framesDelayed variables correctly. In challenge 5 I was abe to identify and fix that issue. I also changed how the pool balls breeding worked by actually using a constructor so that it would be functional long term. Now there are 2 cue balls moving around the screen at different rates and when they collide with a pool ball it is removed, and when two pool balls collide they succesfully duplicate.
